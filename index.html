<p style="text-align: left;">Hello!!! I am an Augmented Reality Engineer at Aireal contributing to the development and advancement of Geospatial AR platform.</p>
I graduated from The University of Texas at Dallas with a Master's degree in Computer Science in December 2016. I was a Graduate Researcher at Future Immersive Virtual Environments (FIVE) Lab under Dr. Ryan McMahan where I developed Virtual Reality applications and related user studies. I presented one of my accepted papers in IEEE 3DUI Symposium in March 2016.

I interned in the Product Innovation Team at BMW, Mountain View in Summer 2016 and at Intel in Fall 2015 where I received recognition for rapid prototyping efforts.

Before joining grad school, I used to work on infotainment modules in TCS for Jaguar cars. I keep myself updated with the latest news in technology by interacting with people at city Meetups or subscribing to the hundreds of tweet feeds. I enjoy giving tech talks at Meetups.

I am passionate about hackathons. My team won the first prize in engineering category in Reality Virtually Hack at MIT Media Lab. Also, my project IOTxMR at Holohack by Microsoft was featured in Digital Trends.
<p style="text-align: left;">I believe in continuous learning and connecting as many dots as possible.</p>
